# Backbone Essentials
## Chapter1: Building Single-Page Site Using Backbone
Backbone requires JQuery and optionally Underscore.    
Backbone is made up of the following five major tools.  
* A class system
* A Model class
* A collection class
* A View class
* A Router class

## Chapter 2: Object-Oriented JavaScript with Backbone Classes  
Every variable in JavaScript is either an Object, a function or a Primitive.  

The new keyword does four thing when used for a function:
1. Creates a brand new object({}).     
2. Sets _this_ inside the initialization function to the newly created object.    
3. Returns the new Object and ignore return statement in the function.   
4. Sets the \__proto\__ of the new object it creates to the *prototype* property of the initialization function.   

Every object in JavaScript has two special properties: *prototype* and \__proto\__.
